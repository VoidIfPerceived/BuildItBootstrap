### Build-It Bootstrap 

# Web App Design with React Router Week 16 Coding Assignment

## Description

This was originally the final project for my Promineo Tech Front End Web Development Bootcamp *(Shout-Out Promineo Tech)* and is slowly morphing into my portfolio page for several projects.
This webapp is built with React, React-Router, React-Bootstrap, and Axios.
It's been a joy to work on this project and I hope to continue to grow it as my skills become more well rounded.

## Future Plans

***Logging In and Specific User Site Editing*** : The ability to **log in** as a user to edit one's own
    Build-It Bootstrap "site"
***Specific User Site Viewing*** : The ability to **view other "sites"** other than the Build-It Bootstrap
    main "site"
    *Page Search Bar* : A **basic search bar** that leads to the below mentioned *Page Search Page*
    *Page Search Page* : A results page **akin to a search engine page**, where you can find other user's
        pages and **search by specific key words or phrases**
***Modal Container for Editor menus*** : Also includes log-in "page"
***Adjustable Image Sizing***
***More Styling Options other than stock Bootstrap***

***Backend homemade API for storing user data and sites***

## Instructions 

1. Clone Repository
2. Navigate to the Build-It Bootstrap Folder
3. Run npm install to install all dependencies
4. Run npm start to run the webapp
